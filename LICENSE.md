## Content Ownership and Such

"Thegamar" (The Game) reserves the exclusive right to any and all content created for, by or in this repository and other official Thegamar repositories. This includes but is not limited to the following (so as long as they are unique to this world at the time of creation):

- Content, Lore & World Entities
- Gameplay Algorithms (Logical & Mathematical)
- Scripts and Source (and other such intellectual property)
- Media assets (if and when applicable)

The above is an example, not a complete list, of content which remains the property of The Game. This repository and project is now Open Source, which allows the general public to view and contribute to the content herein. Any such property of The Game is not to be redistributed in an unofficial, modified format, repackaged under different branding, or sold or used in any which generates a profit, except by Eisert Development, LLC.

The public is free to use this for any private purposes, so as long as it is made exceptionally clear to users that it is not an officially licensed representation of The Game. If you wish to host an official Thegamar server, get in touch and we'll talk.

BASICALLY: The Game is part of a project which has hundreds of thousands of hours of work already fronted, a lot of money paid to artists and content writers to fill it with content, and the heart and soul of the creator who dreamed it up. I (the Creator) want people to enjoy and learn from the technology used, and to contribute to a bigger and better world, so I'm opening up the source code, but that does not mean I am giving it away for free, and I don't want anything harming the image, brand or reputation of The Game.

## Contributor's License

If any person would like to contribute to this project, you can follow the (probably not yet documented) Contribution Guidelines at the bottom of the Readme, submit a Pull Request and go down in history as a steward of the world and creator of universes. I make no promises of compensation because, frankly, I don't have a whole lot of dollars. This is a license agreement so I can't promise anything, but off the record: we can talk.

The Creator (hi) reserves the right to reject, refuse and/or modify any contribution for any reason whatsoever. This line is here so people can't be upset when their lore about Tolok falling in love with Humans is altered to be more in-character. You are allowed to, as long as you label it an independent and unofficial contribution, create whatever lore and stories you want; just know that anything and everything created in relation to this has a possibility of suddenly becoming official, with or without compensation, but usually with. Again, license agreement, not making promises.
